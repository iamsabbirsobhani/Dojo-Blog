## The Composition API

 1. Composition API Basics
we can perform any JavaScript coding into setup() function. we can create function, variable, object, import function from other component by importing them etc. We can perform Option API as well as Composition API simultaneously. Option API generally think to build simple project while Composition API think to complex and large project. But both are useful under the different circumstances. We can `return{}` the values inside the `setup()` function if we want to make them accessible in the `<template>`. This is the very basic of how to use the Composition API. We make a setup function or setup if you prefer to call it that way, that always runs first before created before mounted etc. And, inside this `setup()`, we can run any JavaScript Such as create values or create functions. Then at the end down`(line 38)` here in `return{},` we just return whatever values or functions we want to make available to the component `<template>`.
